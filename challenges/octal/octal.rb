Implement octal to decimal conversion. Given an octal input string,
your program should produce a decimal output. Treat invalid input as octal 0.

Note: Implement the conversion yourself. Don't use any built-in or library
methods that perform the necessary conversions for you. In this exercise,
the code necessary to perform the conversion is what we're looking for,

About Octal (Base-8)

Decimal is a base-10 system. A number 233 in base 10 notation can be understood
as a linear combination of powers of 10:

The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 100 = 1
The next digit gets multiplied by 101 = 10
The digit after that gets multiplied by 102 = 100
The digit after that gets multiplied by 103 = 1000
...
The n*th* digit gets multiplied by 10n-1.
All of these values are then summed.

Thus:
  233 # decimal
= 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 3*10^0
= 2*100  + 3*10   + 3*1

Octal numbers are similar, but they use a base-8 system. A number 233 in base 8
can be understood as a linear combination of powers of 18:

The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 80 = 1
The next digit gets multiplied by 81 = 8
The digit after that gets multiplied by 82 = 64
The digit after that gets multiplied by 83 = 512
...
The n*th* digit gets multiplied by 8n-1.
All of these values are then summed.

Thus:
  233 # octal
= 2*8^2 + 3*8^1 + 3*8^0
= 2*64  + 3*8   + 3*1
= 128   + 24    + 3
= 155

###############################

Explicit
- write program that implements octal to decimal conversion
- invalid input treated as octal 0
- should take a string and produce a decimal output
- base 10 asnd base 8 are rexplained above

Implicit
- constructor method will take one string argument
- invalid inputs will return 0
- the `to_decimal` instance method will return an integer
- base 8 only uses digits 0-7

DS
- strings for input
- integers for output
- arrays for calculations

Algo(s)
- return 0 unless valid_octal?
- convert given string to integer and split into array of digits
- initialize counter to -1
- loop through digits
  - multiply current num by 8 to the power of (absolute value of counter - 1)
  - increment counter
- find sum of arr and return

- valid_octal?
  - only contains digits 0-7?
