  - Why?
  - Yielding
    - `yield` keyword
    - `LocalJumpError`
    - Making yield optional
  - Passing execution to the block
  - Yielding with an Argument
    - Block parameter vs Block local variable
    - Arguments passed to a block vs passed to a method
    - **Arity**
  - Return value of yielding to the block
  - When to use blocks in your own methods
    - Defer some implementation details til implementations

Key Points

- blocks are one way that Ruby implements closures. Closures are a way to pass around an unnamed "chunk of code" to be executed later.
- blocks can take arguments, just like normal methods. But unlike normal methods, it won't complain about wrong number of arguments passed to it.
- blocks return a value, just like normal methods.
- blocks are a way to defer some implementation decisions to method invocation time. It allows method callers to refine a method at invocation time for a specific use case. It allows method implementors to build generic methods that can be used in a variety of ways.
- blocks are a good use case for "sandwich code" scenarios, like closing a File automatically.
- methods and blocks can return a chunk of code by returning a Proc or lambda.

Build a "times" method from scratch

```ruby
#method definition
def times(num)
  counter = 0
  
  while counter < num
    yield(counter)
    counter += 1
  end
  
  num
end

# method invocation
# block passed in with #times method is invoked by the yield keyword in the method definition
times(5) do |current_num|
  puts current_num
end

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# => 5
```

---

Build an "each" method from scratch

```ruby
# Method definition
def each(arr)
  counter = 0
  
  while counter < arr.size
    yield(arr[counter])
    counter += 1
  end
  
  arr
end

# method invocation
# block passed in with #times method is invoked by the yield keyword in the method definition
each([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) do |element|
  puts element * 2
end
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

---

- Build an "select" method from scratch

```ruby
# Method definition
def new_select(arr)
  counter = 0
  new_arr = []
  
  while counter < arr.size
    # return value of block used to check for truthiness
    if yield(arr[counter])
      new_arr << arr[counter]
    end
    
    counter += 1
  end
  
  new_arr
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# method invocations
# block passed in with #times method is invoked by the yield keyword in the method definition
p new_select(array) { |num| num.odd? } == [1, 3, 5] # true
p new_select(array) { |num| puts num } == [] # outputs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and returns true
p new_select(array) { |num| num + 1 } == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # true
```

---

Build an "reduce" method from scratch

```ruby
def reduce(arr, starts_at=0)
  accumulator = starts_at

  arr.each do |num|
    accumulator = yield(accumulator, num)
  end
  
  accumulator
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

p reduce(array) { |acc, num| acc + num } == 15        # true
p reduce(array, 10) { |acc, num| acc + num } == 25    # true
p reduce(array) { |acc, num| acc + num if num.odd? }  # => NoMethodError
```

- Build a todo list
  - Why would we prefer to build a custom method for a class vs using a built in method that we can call on collections contained within the objects state?
    - This is the idea behind encapsulation: we want to hide implementation details from users of the TodoList class, and not encourage users of this class to reach into its internal state. Instead, we want to encourage users of the class to use the interfaces (ie, public methods) we created for them.
    - The entire goal of creating a class and encapsulating logic in a class is to hide implementation details and contain ripple effects when things change. Prefer to use the class's interface where possible.

- Blocks and variable scope
- symbol to proc

## Questions

- What is a closure?
- How do we implement closures in Ruby?
- Why do we need closures?
- What tools do we have for implementing closures in Ruby?
- What is binding?
- What is a block?
- What can we do with blocks?
- How is a block different from a methods implementation?
- How can we pass a block to a method and have it executed?
- What occurs is we don't pass a block to a method invocation that contains the `yield` keyword?
- How can we check if a block has been passed in as an argument with a method invocation?
- What are the 2 components of code execution regarding methods?
- What is the sequence of code execution for a method?
  1. Method invocation, implicit and explicit arguments passed in.
  2. Method local variables (parameters) are initialized to the values explicitly passed in to the method definition. The block is implicitly passed in to the method definition.
  3. Method body code is executed from top to bottom.
      - If a `yield` keyword is called the method execution immediately _yields_ to the block passed in at invocation and executes the code within the block.
      - Otherwise the code within the method definition is executed line by line.
  4. The method returns the last expressions value of the method.

- How would we differentiate the different arguments types of a method invocation?
  Answer:
  - A String/Integer/Object defined by the method definition is an _explicit argument_.
  - A block passed in at method invocation is a _implicit argument_ not included in the method definition.
- What is a block parameter and block local variable and what is special about the latter?
- Can you pass an argument to a block using the `yield` keyword?
- What is _arity_ and whats the difference between lenient and strict?
- What happens when you pass more/less arguments than the block has calling for?
