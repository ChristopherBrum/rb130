# STUDY GUIDE

## Blocks

- Closures, binding, and scope
- How blocks work, and when we want to use them.
- Blocks and variable scope
- Write methods that use blocks and procs
- Understand that methods and blocks can return chunks of code (closures)
- Methods with an explicit block parameter
- Arguments and return values with blocks
- When can you pass a block to a method
- &:symbol
- Arity of blocks and methods
  - Lambdas are types of Proc's. Technically they are both Proc objects. An implicit block is a grouping of code, a type of closure, it is not an Object.
  - Lambdas enforce the number of arguments passed to them. Implicit blocks and Procs do not enforce the number of arguments passed in.
