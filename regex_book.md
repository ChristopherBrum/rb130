## Introduction

## What are Regular Expressions?

Regex are **patterns** that we use to find information within a set of strings. We can use them 
to perform conditional tests, extract desired information, or modify information.

Each language has its own implementation of regex, but much of it applies regardless of language implementation.

### What Are Regex Used For?

We can use regex patterns to do many different things. For example:

- Check whether the pattern ss appears in the string Mississippi.
- Check whether the letter i occurs three or more times in Mississippi.
- Find and replace all instances of Mrs with Ms in a document.
- Does a file name begin with Bob and end with .txt or .md?
- Does a string have any non-alphanumeric characters in it?
- Did the user enter a valid integer?
- Are there any whitespace characters in the string?
- Find and replace all non-alphanumeric characters in a string with -.
- Locate all email addresses in a document.
- Split a line of text into fields assuming that each whitespace character delimits two values.

### A First Taste

At its most basic, regex are a string of characters between two `/` characters. For instance, we can find any occurrences of the string `'cat'` within some body of text with this expression: `/cat/`. This expression will match with `cat`, `cathy`, `scatter`, and `scat`. It will not match with `Cat` or `c a t`, though.

When things get more complex you can find regex patterns that look like: `/\bhttps?:\/\/\S+\?/`, which will find any web url that contains a query string. So even though it can look like nonsense, regex can be quite powerful.
  
### How often will I use Regex?

This depends on your role as a developer. If you do a lot of manipulation of strings then: yes. And most developer roles will have you manipulating strings to a greater or lesser degree.

## Regular Expressions

### Basic Matching

At its most simplest form regex can be used to match substrings within a string or body of text.

#### Alphanumerics

Alphanumerics are the most basic off all patterns we can match using regex. You can construct an alphanumeric regex pattern by placing a letter or a number between two `/` characters.

For example, `/s/` matches the letter `s` anywhere within a string that it appears. It matches `cats`, `sack`, `custard`, and `Mississippi`. In the last example `/s/` matches 4 times, for each of the `s`'s in `Mississippi`.

It's important to note that `/s/` does not match `S` or `CATS`. `s` and `S` are different ascii characters.

We can put this into action like so:

```ruby
str = 'cast'
print "matched 's'" if str.match(/s/) # matched 's' 
print "matched 'x'" if str.match(/x/) # no output
```

Documentation for the Ruby method `#match` can be found [here](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.0/Regexp.html#method-i-match)

#### Special Characters

Regex can also match non-alphanumeric characters, but because some of these special characters have a specific meaning in regex they may require special treatment.

The following characters have special meaning in regex:

`$ ^ * + ? . ( ) [ ] { } | \ /`

Characters that have a special meaning in regex are called **meta-characters**. In order to match a _literal meta-character_ you must prepend the character with a backslash(`\`). For example, to match a question mark you would do this: `/\?\`.

Special characters that are _not_ meta-characters have not special behavior and can be treated without the backslash(`\`). For instance, the colon(`:`) and the semi-colon(`;`) are not meta-characters and can be targeted like alpha-numeric characters.

When using meta-characters within square brackets things change. Which we'll cover shortly.

> As of this moment, Rubular does not support blank spaces, so square brackets must be used to target blank spaces. `/[ ]/` will be equivalent to `/ /` in Rubular.

#### Concatenation

You can _concatenate_ two or more patterns into a new pattern. The pattern `/cat/` is actually a concatenation of the regex pattern `/c/`, `/a/`, and `/t/` concatenated together. `/cat/` will match any string that contains a `c` followed by an `a` and then followed by a `t`.

This should illuminate that we can concatenate any pattern to another pattern to produce a larger regex. This is at the heart of regex:
>_patterns are the building blocks of regex_, not characters or strings.

You can construct complex regex by concatenating a series of patterns, and you can analyze a complex regex by breaking it down into its component patterns.

#### Alternation

**Alternation** is a simple way to construct a regex that matches one of several sub-patterns. At it's most basic it's done by separating different regex patterns with the `|` character. For example:

```txt
/(cat|dog|mouse)/
```

...can be used to match any text that has any of these patterns found within. Again, _case matters_. There is no built-in restriction on the number of alternations added to a regex pattern. In this example we did not prepend the `(`, `)`, or `|` characters with a backslash(`\`) because we wanted to use the "meta" meaning of those special characters.

#### Control Character Escapes

Most modern programming languages use **control character escapes** to represent characters that are not represented in a visual way. For example, `\n`, `\r\`, and `\t` are almost universally used to represent _new lines_, _carriage returns_, and _tabs_.

```ruby
puts "has tab" if text.match(/\t/)
```

This prints `has tab` if `text` contains a tab character.

#### Ignoring Case

Regex gives us other options for the patterns we're matching, the documentation refers to these _options_ as **flags** or **modifiers**. One such option is appending `i` to the end of the regex expression after the last `/` character, like this: `/launch/i`. What this does is tells the regex to ignore case in this circumstance. Below, without the optional `i` telling the regex to ignore case only the third line `launchschool.com` will match, but with the `i` appended to the close of the regex all `Launch`, `LAUNCH`, and `launch`(school.com) will be highlighted.

```txt
I love Launch School!
LAUNCH SCHOOL! Gotta love it!
launchschool.com
```

### Character Classes

#### Set of Characters

_Character class patterns_ match a single occurrences of any character within the square brackets. `/[abc]/` will find all occurrences of `a`, `b`, or `c` found within a string. So for the string `alphabetically` there will be three matches to `a` and one match for `b` and `c`. This can be utilized when asking a user for some type of input, for example choosing from a selection numbered 1 to 5 can be checked with `/[12345]/`, and asking for a `y/n` input can be checked with `/[ynYN]/`. Character classes also can be beneficial if you cannot use the `i` option to ignore case, for example: `/[Hh]oover/` matches `Hoover` and `hoover` but not `HOOVER`.

Character classes act as concatenation within your regex patterns. The last example `/[Hh]oover/` showed that the first letter of the string ending with `oover` could be a number of different characters. This can also be done with other character classes concatenated together, like: `/[abc][123]/`. This will match with any string that has a first character of `a`, `b`, or `c`, and a second character of `1`, `2`, or `3`.

It's good practice to organize like-character types together; digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, whitespace, etc. It will still if they are not arranged in a particular order but for readability grouping non-alphanumerical characters in the beginning or end of a character class is recommended.

Within a character class the number of meta-characters lessens only to:

`^` `\` `-` `[` `]`

Sometimes this depends on their position within a character class. For example, you can use `^` as a non-meta-character if it isn't the first character in the class, and you can use `-` as a non-meta-character if it is the first character in the class. You can also escape special characters even if not required in the circumstance.

#### Range of Characters

By using the hyphen(`-`) in a character class you can include a range of characters to look through for a match. `/[a-z]/` will match any lowercase letter, `/[A-Z]/` will match any uppercase number, and `/[a-z0-9]/` will match any lowercase letter or decimal digit.

Do not try to match ranges between special characters or uppercase and lowercase number. There are characters found between upper and lowercase letters and attempting to do things like `/[A-z]/` will yield unexpected results.

#### Negated Classes

We can use the `^` character at the beginning of a character class to negate the results you're trying to match. For example `/[abc]/` will match any instance of the characters `a`, `b` or `c` in a string, but `/[^abc]/` will match all characters that are _not_ `a`, `b` or `c` in a string. This works for individual character as well as ranges.

### Character Class Shortcuts

#### Any Character

A quick way to match with any character regardless of its type is to use the _any_ character (`.`). This character class pattern, `/./`, will match with any character expect for characters that are not typically seen, like newline characters, ot tab characters.

#### Whitespace

Whitespace characters are:

- the space (`' '`)
- tab (`\t`)
- vertical tab (`\v`)
- carriage return (`\r`)
- line feed (`\n`)
- form feed (`\f`)

Two frequently used shortcuts for character classes are the _whitespace shortcut_(`\s`) and the _non-whitespace shortcut_(`\S`).

```ruby
puts 'matched 1' if 'Four score'.match(/\s/)
puts 'matched 2' if "Four\tscore".match(/\s/)
puts 'matched 3' if "Four-score\n".match(/\s/)
puts 'matched 4' if "Four-score".match(/\s/)

# matched 1
# matched 2
# matched 3
```

The above code outputs `matched 1`, `matched 2`, and `matched 3` because some form of whitespace has been found within the string being matched, but the last string does not.

```ruby
puts 'matched 1' if 'a b'.match(/\S/)
puts 'matched 2' if " \t\n\r\f\v".match(/\S/)

# matched 1
```

`matched 1` is output because a non-whitespace character is found within the string being matched but the second there is not.

`\s` and `\S` can be used in and out of the square brackets. Outside square brackets, e.g., /\s/, it stands for one of the whitespace characters. Inside square brackets, e.g., /[a-z\s]/, they represent an alternative to the other members of the class. Here, for instance, it represents any lowercase alphabetic character or any whitespace character.

#### Digits and Hex Digits

We have shortcuts for _decimal digits_, `0-9`, and the _hexadecimal digits_, `0-9`, `A-F`, and `a-f`, because they're commonly found in character classes.

| Shortcut | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `\d` | Any decimal digit (0-9) |
| `\D` | Any character but a decimal digit |
| `\h` | Any hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F, a-f) (Ruby) |
| `\H` | Any character but a hexadecimal digit (Ruby) |

Just like `\s` and `\S` these shortcuts can be used in and out of brackets.

#### Word Characters

`\w` matches _word characters_ and `\W` matches _non-word characters_. 'Word characters' does not mean alphabetical characters only, it encompasses all upper and lowercase letters(`a-z` and `A-Z`), all decimal digits(`0-9`), and the underscore(`_`).

These can be used in or out of brackets.

### Anchors

_Anchors_ allows us control how regex matches a string by telling the regex engine where matches can begin and where they can end. Anchors do not match characters, they tell specify where regex looks for matches in a string or body of text. This can be at the beginning or end of a string or line, or on a word or non-word-boundary.

### Start and End of Line

The `^` and `$` _meta-characters_ are **anchors** that specify the regex match at the beginning(`^`) or end(`$`) of a line of text, which can be different that the beginning or end of a string, but not always.

### Lines vs Strings

This can become more complicated when working with multiline string because we now how `\n`

```ruby
TEXT1 = "red fish\nblue fish"
puts "matched red" if TEXT1.match(/^red/)
puts "matched blue" if TEXT1.match(/^blue/)

# matched red
# matched blue
```

This outputs both `matched red` and `matched blue` because the `\n` character within `TEXT1` pushes `blue fish` to a newline and the `^` anchor looks for a match at the beginning of each _line_.

```ruby
TEXT2 = "red fish\nred shirt"
puts "matched fish" if TEXT2.match(/fish$/)
puts "matched shirt" if TEXT2.match(/shirt$/)

# matched fish
# matched shirt
```

This is the same reason that both `matched fish` and `matched shirt` are output by this code. The `$` anchor looks at the end of each _line_ for the pattern to match, which matches because of the `\n`.

### Start and End of String

More often than needing to match at the beginning or the end of a line we will need to match at the beginning or end of a _string_, and for these situations we have `\A`, `\z`, and `\Z`(there is no `\a`).

- `\A` matches at the beginning of a string.
- `\z` and `\Z` both match at the end of a string, but:
  - `\z` always matches at the end of a string, and...
  - `\Z` matches up to, but not including, a newline at the end of a string.

In general just use `\z` unless you actually have a situation where you need `\Z`.

```ruby
TEXT3 = "red fish\nblue fish"
TEXT4 = "red fish\nred shirt"
puts "matched red" if TEXT3.match(/\Ared/)
puts "matched blue" if TEXT3.match(/\Ablue/)
puts "matched fish" if TEXT4.match(/fish\z/)
puts "matched shirt" if TEXT4.match(/shirt\z/)

# matched red
# matched shirt
```

### Word Boundaries

The `\B` and `\b` anchors anchor regex matches to _word boundaries_(`\b`) and _non-word boundaries_(`\B`). To these anchors words are considered sequences of word characters(`\w`) and non-words are considered sequences of non-word characters(`\W`).

A word boundary occurs:

- between any pair of characters, one of which is a word character and one which is not.
- at the beginning of a string if the first character is a word character.
- at the end of a string if the last character is a word character.

A non-word boundary occurs:

- between any pair of characters, both of which are word characters or both of which are not word characters.
- at the beginning of a string if the first character is a non-word character.
- at the end of a string if the last character is a non-word character.

```txt
Eat some food.
```

Here, word boundaries occur before the `E`, `s`, and `f` at the start of the three words, and after the `t`, `e`, and `d` at their ends. Non-word boundaries occur elsewhere, such as between the `o` and `m` in `some`, and following the `.` at the end of the sentence.

The regex pattern `/\b\w\w\w\b/` will match with any 3 letter words consisting of "word characters" with word boundaries at the start and end of the word.

```txt
One fish,
Two fish,
Red fish,
Blue fish.
123 456 7890
```

This code will match with `One` , `Two`, `Red`, `123`, and `456`.

`\b` and `\B` do not working within brackets of character classes.
