## What are Regular Expressions?

Regex are **patterns** that we use to find information within a set of strings. We can use them to perform conditional tests, extract desired information, or modify information.

Each language has its own implementation of regex, but much of it applies regardless of language implementation.

### What Are Regex Used For?

We can use regex patterns to do many different things. For example:

- Check whether the pattern ss appears in the string Mississippi.
- Check whether the letter i occurs three or more times in Mississippi.
- Find and replace all instances of Mrs with Ms in a document.
- Does a file name begin with Bob and end with .txt or .md?
- Does a string have any non-alphanumeric characters in it?
- Did the user enter a valid integer?
- Are there any whitespace characters in the string?
- Find and replace all non-alphanumeric characters in a string with -.
- Locate all email addresses in a document.
- Split a line of text into fields assuming that each whitespace character delimits two values.
