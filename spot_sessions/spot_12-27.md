# STUDY GUIDE

** Practice using Minitest

## Blocks

- Closures, binding, and scope
- How blocks work, and when we want to use them.
- Blocks and variable scope
- Write methods that use blocks and procs
- Understand that methods and blocks can return chunks of code (closures)
- Methods with an explicit block parameter
- Arguments and return values with blocks
- When can you pass a block to a method
- &
- &:symbol
- Arity
  - **Lenient Arity**: blocks and Procs
  - **Strict Arity**: methods and lambdas

## Testing With Minitest

- Testing terminology
- Minitest vs. RSpec
  - Minitest:
    - used to be included with Ruby, now needs to be installed with a gem
    - Uses assertion style, but has option for using spec-style w/ DSL
  - RSpec:
    - uses spec-style (expectation style)
    - DSL
    - is more english read-writeable
- SEAT approach
- Assertions
  - assertions are _verification step_ within a test/test-case

## Core Tools/Packaging Code

- Purpose of core tools
- Gemfiles
